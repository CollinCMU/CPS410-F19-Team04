I know GitHub can be iffy with Unity projects, so here is a zipped version of the project folder that shouldn't have any issues when you open it.

It was made with Unity version 2018.4.12f1. I'm not sure if other versions of Unity will work but feel free to try.

I'm also not sure how experienced with Unity you are, but I will try to make things clear and brief.
Hopefully by looking through the Hierarchies of the different scenes in Unity, you should get a better idea of how the game and levels are structured.

You can create a level by creating a new empty scene, or by copying and pasting an existing level and change/move/delete things as you please. 

You can draw the ground and platforms using the Tile Palette (Window -> 2D -> Tile Palette)
Just be sure that you draw spikes on the "Spikes" tilemap and everything else on the "Ground" tilemap.

Inside the prefabs folder, you'll see Player, Door, and checkpointFlag. These will work right out of the box, so just drag them into the scene. 
Just be sure there is a "Spawnpoint" gameobject in the scene for the checkpoint to work. 

The "CameraBoundary" object in the hierarchy does what the name implies. It's a polygon collider that limits the camera movement.
You can click the Edit Collider button in the inspector to change where the camera can go.

To add levels to the level select, look at the "Level Select" scene's hierarchy.
In (Canvas -> Level Select -> LevelContainer), each Level object is actually a button with an On Click script attached.
Inside the string field, just type in the name of the scene that you wish to load when the button is clicked.

That should be a pretty good start, I hope you found it helpful.

I wish you luck on your exams this semester, and I hope you have a nice winter break.

Best, Collin V.
